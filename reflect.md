For this IDP I was looking at some photos of outerspace and was inspired to make a desighn that moved and reflected the images I saw. At the start I was a little stuck and did not know where to start. I looked back at the photos and saw alot of colorfull circles and I  visualized what I had to do. I started off by using vectors to do the shape and directoin of the lines. after I got the shapes I wanted I was having trouble with the positions. This was surprising because I usualy do not have any trouble with this. I looked at some online sources for some help and it worked. I got the exact end I wanted. This was my favoite IDP of the year because I better learned how to problem solve.
